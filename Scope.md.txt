In scope:
- Real-time fill-level monitoring (ultrasonic sensor)
- Environmental sensing (temperature, humidity, gas concentration)
- Local visual feedback (OLED, LEDs) and audio (buzzer)
- Remote alerts (Telegram) and cloud logging (ThingSpeak)
- Simple servo-actuated lid mechanism
- Documentation for hardware, software, and deployment

Out of scope:
- Full fleet management mobile app (this project provides data and a dashboard)
- Advanced ML analytics (basic visualization only)
- Rugged industrial enclosures (recommendations provided)
