**ThingSpeak dashboard**
- Create a new ThingSpeak channel.
- Fields recommended: `field1`=distance_cm, `field2`=temperature_C, `field3`=humidity_pct, `field4`=gas_pct
- Use ThingSpeak built-in charts for each field and a combined view.

**Recommended analytics**
- Daily fill-level trend per bin (to spot peak hours)
- Average gas levels (safety monitoring)
- Alerts table (when bin full, timestamp)
