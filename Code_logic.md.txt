**Code logic summary**

1. Connect to Wi-Fi and verify connectivity.
2. Read sensors periodically:
   - Ultrasonic for distance -> compute fill level
   - DHT22 for temperature & humidity
   - MQ2 for gas level (analog)
3. Update local OLED display and LEDs / buzzer based on thresholds.
4. Send sensor readings to ThingSpeak for plotting (fields: distance, temp, hum, gas).
5. If bin is full (distance threshold), send Telegram alert (one shot, with rate limiting).
6. Control servo: keep lid open normally, close when bin is full (optional safety logic).
7. Retry network operations with exception handling.
